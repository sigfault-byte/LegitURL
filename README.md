# Overview

**LegitURL** is a lightweight mobile app that analyzes the trustworthiness of any URL using a transparent, heuristic-driven approach. All scans are conducted locally and completed in ~2 seconds. No cloud analysis, no data leaks. just fast, explainable results.

See the [examples](https://github.com/sigfault-byte/LegitURL/blob/main/Examples/README.md) for sanitized case studies of real-world phishing links, complete with PDF exports, structured JSON, and LLM reasoning outputs.

### Key features:
- **Instant risk scoring** â€“ assigns ðŸŸ©/ðŸŸ§/ðŸŸ¥ based on 100+ deterministic checks  
- **Security-focused** â€“ detects silent redirects, CSP misconfigurations, suspicious TLS certificates, and tracking behavior  
- **Explainable results** â€“ every finding is traceable to a rule; no black-box logic  
- **Privacy-first design** â€“ a single HTTPS request, no third-party traffic, zero analytics  
- **Exportable reports** â€“ generate PDFs or LLM-ready JSON for external review

## Media Coverage

### *Cyberdefense Magazine* (July 2025)
> **"LegitURL offers a unique approach to link analysis â€” blending pedagogy and precision in a tool designed for everyone."**

<details><summary>Excerpt from the article</summary>

> [...]  
> But **encryption** is not **authentication**.  
> Rendering is not endorsement.  
> Even seemingly benign links can conceal redirect chains, cloaked infrastructure, or misconfigured policies â€” all while wearing the lock like a badge.  
> I often tell non-technical users to imagine a website as a shop, and their browser as a **guide** or **bodyguard**.  
> That guide will help them get inside, translate unknown languages, and smooth over bumps in the experience.  
> But how many of us would willingly enter a **shop** with **crumbling walls, broken stairs, sticky notes slapped on our chest**, and **strangers watching our every move**, while the bodyguard just smiles and quietly patches the walls?

## Scoring System

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ðŸŸ¥ **High risk** | Multiple critical signals: expired/mismatched certs, missing CSP, scam patterns, cloaking, etc. |
| ðŸŸ§ **Moderate risk** | Mixed or partial protection. Often seen with major brands but warrants caution. |
| ðŸŸ© **Low risk** | Clean redirect flow, strong TLS, proper headers, no tracking or obfuscation detected. |

## Getting Started

| | |
|---|---|
| **End-users** | Download via the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/legiturl/id6745583794) |
| **Developers** | Open `LegitURL.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build directly. |

## How it works

1. **Offline static parsing**  
   Detects homograph attacks, encoded words, scam phrases, entropy anomalies, and more.

2. **Sandboxed HTTPS fetch**  
   Retrieves headers, HTML body, TLS certificate, cookies, and inline JavaScript.

3. **Deterministic scoring engine**  
   Findings set bit-flags â†’ weighted penalties â†’ a single final score with full traceability.

See [`TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md`](TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md) for detailed logic and implementation

## Roadmap

### Completed
- [x] Cookie bit-flag pyramid
- [x] CSP / header correlation
- [x] HTML `<meta refresh>` detection

### In progress
- [ ] Correlate CSP SHA to inline 
- [ ] Subresource-Integrity (SRI) hash checks  
- [ ] Consolidated CSP generator
- [ ] Implement OpenSSL probe to retrieve certificate chain and reason for failed TLS handshake
